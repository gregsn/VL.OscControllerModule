# An OSC Controller module POC

A POC of an OSC Controller module for Global Channels to get familiar with the new binding feature. This module allows to hook some OSC input to Global Channels. It works with primitive and custom datatypes.

## Usage

There's a `/help` folder with a patch named `HowTo Use the OSC Module.vl`. Open this file with a recent vvvv gamma preview and you should be good to go.

## Motivation

For fun really, don't use for production :p
